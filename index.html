        <p class="mx-10">We all know that iRacing encourages antisocial behavior - divebombs, "punt to
            pass", "netcode" collisions. Win or place at all costs. You are rewarded for good results on each race
            (+IR), while there are limited rewards for safe racing - there are only 6 license classes. Heck, you don't
            even need a A Class license for open wheelers - there are very few series that even require it!

        <p class="mx-10">Rather than sacrifice SR for IR (what most of us do on the regular) the innovation of F499 is to prioritize
            safety and good racing hygiene. We want to be better racing drivers, not just drivers with large collections
            of fake internet points. We chose SR as our driving metric. Our goal is 4.99 SR.</p>
